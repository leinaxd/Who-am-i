# What am i doing?
I'm an undergraded Electronic Engineer specialized in Control Theory and Signal Processing, however in the last years Machine Learning has taken my complete interest.

Currently i'm working on my personal CodeBank repository, which contains a collection of useful scripts for fast development.
Inside each file there is a unit-test implemented together with its documentation.

If you are interested about my programming skills, please peek inside any folder in CodeBank.


- CodeBank: A lot of tiny code about everything
- MyCodeBase: A lot of Demos for diferent 

As those repositories are personal, many of their code may be deprecated, incomplete or could have errors.
I constantly change and refactor that code without hesitation. 
As building blocks are isolated, i don't even maintain code i don't use.

# What do i value in code?
The most thing i value in code is code-style, (readibility, documentation, testing, right naming)
The second one is performance.

Why is that?
Those High-level python repositories are reminders of how the algorithm work, 
Once you understood the main idea, implementing in a low level language like C/JS
should be trivial.
